## Short tutorial about my work

### PS(at the beggining i didn't knew about "fork" in github and how does it work, so i don't have all of the dependencies in the my work and can't to pull-request to the your repo(sorry))

## Main files
- Main
- Individual
- PlanetClassifier
- OwnClassifier
- rules.json(in the same map as input.json)


### Why i did like this ? 
I consider that the most correct classifier is by Planet, so first of all, all Individuals should be checked by planet and if planet = null or it's doesn't matched, then check by other parametres. 
I listened about other(senior) methods of the implemintation of the task on the lessons, i will try to do like this next time.
